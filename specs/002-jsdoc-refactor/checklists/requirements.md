# Specification Quality Checklist: JSDoc Refactor for Firebase Events

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-07
**Feature**: [specs/002-jsdoc-refactor/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - _Exception: This is a refactoring task, so technical details are the subject matter._
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - _Value: Maintainability and Developer Experience._
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - _Written for Developers (primary stakeholder for this)._
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - _Exception: Specific tools (ESLint) required._
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - _See Content Quality exception._

## Notes

- This feature is a technical refactor, so standard "no implementation details" rules are relaxed. The requirements explicitly mandate code-level changes (variable renaming, JSDoc tags) which is appropriate for this specific task.
